# Fake News Classification using Na√Øve Bayes
Fake News Classification project using Na√Øve Bayes and NLP techniques to detect misinformation. Implements data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation with ~90% accuracy. Aims to support media literacy by distinguishing real vs fake news effectively.

üìå Overview

This project focuses on building a Fake News Classification System using the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the rapid spread of misinformation, this model aims to help in detecting and classifying news articles as Real or Fake, thereby promoting media literacy and preventing the spread of false information.

üéØ Objectives

Develop a machine learning model to classify news as fake or real.

Preprocess and clean text data using NLP techniques.

Implement Na√Øve Bayes as the core algorithm for classification.

Evaluate model accuracy using performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).

Compare results with other ML models.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Data Collection

Collected dataset of real and fake news articles.

Data Preprocessing

Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

Feature Extraction
